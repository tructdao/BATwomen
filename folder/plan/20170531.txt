Which jobs are most crucial?

      - Drawing is buggy: if you put an index out of bounds after drawing once, the program allows you to draw a second time, it shouldn't.(done)
      - Printing out the leaderboard/winners by using a sort(done)
      - Incorporate an AI as our other version of the game(done)
      - Add calling Uno if one card.(done)
      - If the first card on the discard pile is a black card, any card should work.(done)
      - Processing
Which components constitute core functionality?
      - Incorpoating an AI
      - Ending the game (sort)
      - Calling Uno(done)
      - Debug +4(done)
      - Debug drawing two times(done)
      
      
Non essential?
    - modular design 
    - Processing (extras in our proposal)

Which components are prerequisites for others?
      - Calling Uno and ending the game are prerequisites for incorporating an AI
      
Which tasks can be delegated and which must be collaboratively tackled?
     Bayan:
	- Incorporate more modular design just for easier debugging later(done)
	- if the first card is black any card should work(done)


     Alison:
	- work on ending the game, winning, and sorting the leaderboard


     Truc:
	Change choose version from tournament to vs AI
	Set up the AI


     Everyone:
	- Create an AI which will loop through the hand check for cards that work if a
number card works place it, if not move on to an action card, other wise see if there
is a black card. if not draw check if that card works. if it does place it.
Otherwise move on to the next player(human player).
	- Work on moving everything to processing while having terminal version backed up on github.
	- Keep playing to test for bugs
What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
