Bayan:
	- create subclasses, action card abstract. subclasses for +2,4,wild, skip and reverse.
	-  does card match? (done)
	- ask player what they want to do, get turns to work(done)
Truc:
	- read about mouse clicks on the terminal
	- continue working on plus 4,reverse, plus 2. will have separate subclasses
	-Extremely simple AI. just whichever is the first playable card go for it, for the MVP
Alison:
	- work on skip.
	  - make your comment a reality!
	- in this loop can you add the skip method.


What we have so far:

-  a list of players with names
-  a linked list of cards SHUFFLED woooo!
-  the options working (will be useful later on)
- a basic setup for the discard pile
- Hands are printing woo


IMPORTANT:
- having a turns system so that we can start testing that the game actually works.(done)
- Having a match method to make sure the cards match.(done)
- coding methods for the action cards.
