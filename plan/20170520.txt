5/22
Bayan:
	- display discard pile at all times.  
	- does card match? 
	- ask player what they want to do, get turns to work.
	-display each player's hand when it's their turn.
	-toString for players print player: hand
Alison:
	- get shuffle to work, and add it to newGame() so we can make sure it's working.
	  - (just a possible way) Rqueue has a method called Sample(). each time you add afew cards run sample(), so it's completely out of order.
	  - or you can add them to an arrayList and thenrandomly pick numbers and add it to the deck(inefficient memory space, but that's not that much of a difference).
	- skip
Truc:
	- +2 (dequeue 2 times)
	- +4 (dequeue 4 times and choose color)
	- reverse (DLL switch head and tail i think should work)
