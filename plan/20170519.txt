Bayan Berri, Alison Lee, Truc Dao

5/19-5/20 (Get Basics Down):

Bayan:
	- Start working on starting the game(Reader input stuff)
	  - player names?
	  - asking what version
	  - do you want to see the rules of the game
	    - write rules of the game so that when you run the file it displays.
	   
Alison:
	- Create RQueue for a deck.
	  - 2 of each number in each color(1-9, R,G,Y,B).
	  - 1 zero of each color.
	  - 2 of each action card for each color (+2, reverse, skip)
	  - 4 of each type of wild card( +4, choose color)
	    - just have cards(no effects)
	- Have the deal method working(pop 7 cards per person).
	- Set up basic discard pile(pop one card and push it to the discard pile)

Truc:

	- start working on the tree for the tournament.
	  -our tree will probably not be a binary search tree, it will be a regular binary tree
	       -sketch/draft
	- start working on the action cards methods.
