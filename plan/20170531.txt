Which jobs are most crucial?

      - Drawing is buggy: if you put an index out of bounds after drawing once, the program allows you to draw a second time, it shouldn't.
      - Printing out the leaderboard/winners by using a sort
      - Incorporate an AI as our other version of the game
      - Add calling Uno if one card.
      - If the first card on the discard pile is a black card, any card should work.


Which components constitute core functionality?
      - Incorpoating an AI
      - Ending the game (sort)
Non essential?
    - modular design
    - debug +4
    - debug drawing two times
which components are prerequisites for others?
which tasks can be delegated and which must be collaboratively tackled?
What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?

Bayan:
	- Incorporate more modular design just for easier debugging later


Alison:


Truc:


Everyone:
	- Create an AI which will loop through the hand check for cards that work if a number card works place it, if not move on to an action card, other wise see if there is a black card. if not draw check if that card works. if it does place it. Otherwise move on to the next player(human player).
	- Work on moving everything to processing while having terminal version backed up on github. 

Bugs:

-if +4 is first card on discard pile.
- if you call uno but u have more than 1 card. and the person before u has >1 card--> person that called uno must draw 2 times.

- debug uno out of bounds exception if the player calling uno is the last player then go to player.size()-1
