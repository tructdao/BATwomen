Bayan:
	- Incorporate more modular design just for easier debugging later
	- drawing is buggy if you put an index out of bounds, it lets you draw again(shouldn't happen)	DONEONDONEONDOENODNEON

Alison:
	- Sort for leaderboard

Truc:
	- add option of playing against computer player to chooseVersion()

Everyone:
	- Create an AI which will loop through the hand check for cards that work if a number card works place it, if not move on to an action card, other wise see if there is a black card. if not draw check if that card works. if it does place it. Otherwise move on to the next player(human player).
	- Work on moving everything to processing while having terminal version backed up on github. 

Bugs:

-if +4 is first card on discard pile.
- if you call uno but u have more than 1 card. and the person before u has >1 card--> person that called uno must draw 2 times.

- debug uno out of bounds exception if the player calling uno is the last player then go to player.size()-1
